# Landing Page Project

This came from the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/landing-page).

The purpose of this project is to create a basic landing page using CSS Flexbox.

## Some notes

In the interest of moving on quickly, I have not used any serious content. The point of doing this project was to cement my knowledge of CSS Flexbox, not to make a functional website. I may return to this at a later time and beautify it, but at the moment I consider the project complete.

All photos are mine. They are of my wonderful cats, Claire and Charlotte.
